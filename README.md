# Break Into Tech_SQL

##### Welcome to my SQL portfolio from the Break Into Tech certification program! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written toward the completion of this course which shows basic SQL query knowledge.

Challenge:
We've created a database to track student grades, with their name, number of grade, and what percentage of activities they've completed. 
In this first step, select all of the rows, and display the name, number_grade, and percent_completed, which you can compute by multiplying and rounding the fraction_completed column.

Create a query that will show how many students have earned which letter_grade. 
You can output the letter_grade by using CASE with the number_grade column, outputting 'A' for grades > 90, 'B' for grades > 80, 'C' for grades > 70, and 'F' otherwise. Then you can use COUNT with GROUP BY to show the number of students with each of those grades.

Challenge:
We've created a database for customers and their orders. Not all of the customers have made orders, however. 
Come up with a query that lists the name and email of every customer followed by the item and price of orders they've made.
Use a LEFT OUTER JOIN so that a customer is listed even if they've made no orders, and don't add any ORDER BY.

Create another query that will result in one row per each customer, with their name, email, and total amount of money they've spent on orders. 
Sort the rows according to the total money spent, from the most spent to the least spent.

Challenge:
We've created a database for a friend networking site, with a table storing data on each person, a table on each person's hobbies, and a table of friend connections between the people. 
Use a JOIN to display a table showing people's names with their hobbies.

Use another SELECT with a JOIN to show the names of each pair of friends, based on the data in the friends table.

Challenge:
Query this store database so that you get back the consumer ID plus the total spent for the 2022 year. 
Make sure to list them in descending order so that you get the "top spender" at the top of your results.

Create another query that shows all of the customers that reside in San Diego, CA with name, city, and customer ID listed.
To do this, you need to JOIN the customer_purchases and customer_location tables.

Create one more query to see which purchases are coming from the residents of the Estates on the Hills complex. 
The store owners want to see how many residents of this new complex are now members of their store's shopping membership.
