IMPORT THE DATA AND START EXPLORING:

-- What was the most popular song in 2021?
SELECT artist_name,
    track_name AS song_name,
    popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC;

-- What are the top 10 most popular songs? Provide the artist and song name, in order of popularity score.
SELECT artist_name,
    track_name AS song_name,
    popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- What 5 songs had the highest dancability score?
SELECT artist_name,
    track_name AS song_name,
    danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 5;

-- Let's narrow the results down to the top danceability song.
SELECT artist_name, 
    track_name AS song_name,
    MAX(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

-- What was the song with the longest duration?
SELECT track_name AS song_name,
    MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

-- What was the least loud song in 2021, based on the loudness scoring? Include song name as well as loudness score.
